A lip plumper will make your pout appear bigger; it doesn’t take the place of filler. And when it comes to <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/acne-scar-treatments/>acne scarring</a>? Retinoids can help; but they probably won’t make them disappear. “There are many benefits to using a retinoid, but it’s important to understand that they can’t do everything,” cautions board-certified dermatologist <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.dermatologyboise.com/physicians-and-staff/dr-dustin-portela referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Dr. Dustin Portela.</a> “If you have deep scars, or significant pigmentation you are likely to need additional therapies to improve the appearance.”&nbsp;</p><p>That in mind, there are still plenty of benefits to adding a retinoid into your routine. They can speed up the rate of cell turnover, which can actually reduce the likelihood that you’ll end up with a scar in the first place. To get the full rundown on what retinoids can—and can’t—do for your scarring, keep reading.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-but-first-what-s-an-acne-scar><span>But First: What’s an Acne Scar?</span></h2><p>One of the biggest misconceptions out there is that post-inflammatory <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/news/a25791/how-to-get-ride-of-dark-spots/>hyperpigmentation</a> (PIH), which is the *temporary* mark left behind by a pimple is the same as a scar. PIH will fade over time (likely six weeks), but a scar is pretty permanent. “Acne scars are changes in the skin's texture following acne lesions,” explains Dr. Portela. “They occur when the acne lesion is deep enough, or the inflammatory response is great enough, to disrupt collagen in the dermis."</p><p>When this kind of trauma happens, your skin will create either a raised or depressed scar. “Acne scars can be separated into atrophic (indented) or hypertrophic (raised) types,” he adds. “Atrophic scars may further be classified as ice-pick, rolling, or boxcar scars depending on their depth and width.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-realistically-how-much-can-a-retinoid-help><span>Realistically, How Much Can a Retinoid Help?</span></h2><p>A retinoid’s main job is to speed up cell turnover, which in turn can reduce the likelihood of acne, and to build more collagen in the skin. The combination of both processes has the potential to reduce the look of *some* types of scars. “Topical retinoid medications may help to reduce the appearance of acne scars over time through the production of new collagen,” explains Dr. Portela. “They are more likely to help shallow rolling types of scars. Deeper ice-pick scars, or broad boxcar style scars probably won’t show much improvement even with continued use of retinoids.” In layman's terms, that means that general changes in texture can be improved over time (think: around a year), but small, narrow scars or deep, rounded craters in the skin will remain status quo.&nbsp;</p><p>What retinoids can do? Dramatically speed up the rate at which your post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation fades—and serve as a crucial component in the treatment of active acne. “Retinoid medications help the skin turn over more quickly which can help to carry away unwanted pigment in the upper layers of skin,” says Dr. Portela.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-what-kind-of-retinoid-should-i-look-for><span>What Kind of Retinoid Should I Look For?</span></h2><p>I won’t get into the nitty-gritty, but not all retinoids are created equal. “Prescription-strength retinoid medications are likely to give better results in the treatment of scars,” explains Dr. Portela. “You’re delivering a higher dose of activated retinol to the skin so it can go to work immediately.” Over-the-counter <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/a22777936/what-is-retinol/>retinol</a>, a.k.a. the ones you can get at the drugstore, Sephora, or Ulta, “have to be converted in the skin to the active form before it will start to work.” That means that while it might be gentler on the skin, you are getting a lower percentage of the active ingredient to your skin. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

The best plan for you will be decided on by your dermatologist, but chances are deep scars or intense pigmentation will require additional therapies. One thing to consider? Resurfacing <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/laser-treatments-for-acne-scars/>lasers to treat your acne scars</a>. “Lasers like CO2 or Erbium can help to remodel deeper layers of scar tissue to break up scars and build healthy collagen,” says Dr. Portela. "Other lasers will be much more effective at removing unwanted pigmentation.” More intense topicals, such as hydroquinone or kojic acid, may also be used to target pigmentation.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-meet-the-dermatologist><span>Meet the Dermatologist</span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg><span class=person__name>Dr. Dustin Portela </span><a class=button-social href=# aria-label=INSTAGRAM><span class=button-social__icon></span></a><a class=button-social href=# aria-label=WEBSITE><span class="button-social__icon button-social__icon-website"></span></a>Board Certified Dermatologist<p>Dustin Portela, DO, is a Board Certified Dermatologist and Dermatologic Surgeon.
