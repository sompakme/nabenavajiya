Instead, showrunner Debra J. Fisher and creator Sarah Lampert stuffed the series to the brim. Episode after episode is an exercise in whiplash—the <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/g35618777/ginny-and-georgia-cast-netflix/>cast</a> cycle between love interests; varying degrees of deception; new friendships; a mayoral election; and, yes, even criminal activity. That is to say,&nbsp;Ginny & Georgia&nbsp;is half thriller, half&nbsp;coming of age story,&nbsp;sprinkled with doses of comedy in&nbsp;between serious moments.&nbsp;It's a grab bag, and there's truly something for everyone.</p><p>Season one kicked off with the titular characters in crisis. After a series of unfortunate events that kept the family on the move for over a decade, Georgia Miller (Brianne Howey), a cunning 30-year-old single mother, resolves to settle down in New England with her alienated 15-year-old daughter, Ginny (<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a35614702/who-is-antonia-gentry-ginny-and-georgia/>Antonia Gentry</a>), and nine-year-old son, Austin (Diesel La Torraca). The first season’s 10 episodes explored the cracks in Ginny’s relationship with her secretive mother and her first forays into friendships and romance, all the while tackling issues of race, class, and identity.</p><h2 id=has-xa0-ginny-amp-georgia-xa0-been-renewed-for-a-second-season-3>Has&nbsp;Ginny & Georgia&nbsp;been renewed for a second season?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gi5AW6fwXoAGQtnXTEWTND-1920-80.jpg><p>Yes! On April 19, 2021, Netflix confirmed&nbsp;Ginny & Georgia&nbsp;was renewed for a second season. “We are so appreciative of the incredible response and love you all have shown ‘Ginny & Georgia,” creator Debra J. Fisher said in a&nbsp;statement, per&nbsp;Variety. “We can’t wait to return to <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/a35636415/where-is-ginny-and-georgia-filmed/>Wellsbury</a> for Season 2.”</p><p>In terms of sheer popularity,&nbsp;Ginny & Georgia&nbsp;was destined to get picked up for a second season: 52 million households viewed the series in its first 28 days.&nbsp;This comes in spite of mixed&nbsp;critical reactions&nbsp;to the show, and particularly in light of <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/taylor-swift/>Taylor Swift</a>&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=nofollow data-url="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/benhenry/taylor-swift-ginny-and-georgia-netflix-sexist-joke?utm_source=dynamic&utm_campaign=bffbbuzzfeed&ref=bffbbuzzfeed&" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>taking aim</a>&nbsp;at the show's sexist joke about her. Though the line was widely panned, it's clear that fans fell in love with the show anyway.</p><p>In May of 2021, at the MTV Awards, Gentry teased to press&nbsp;what's to come&nbsp;in the second season: "It's a roller coaster ride. Even I don't know the full details, but I am on the edge of my seat. I know it's going to be a full package of just excitement and plot, and craziness," she said.</p><p>And on December 13, 2022, the first full trailer for season 2 dropped:</p><h2 id=what-apos-s-the-release-date-for-season-two-of-xa0-ginny-and-georgia-3>What's the release date for season two of&nbsp;Ginny and Georgia?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xyKeWN6fsU2QbgpwcNWF8U-1920-80.jpg><p>In December, Deadline's Nellie Andreeva confirmed that Ginny and Georgia season 2 would premiere on Netflix on <strong>January 5, 2023.</strong></p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more. Sign up here.</p><p>The second season didn't come as soon as fans had hoped. In spite of being renewed back in April 2021, season two didn't begin filming until November of 2021, per&nbsp;What's On Netflix. In mid-October of 2021, the show's Instagram page&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.instagram.com/p/CU-XURQL-VJ/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>shared</a>, "Gearing up to film season two let’s take a peek back at filming season one episode one." But as late as March 2022, the show was still filming, according to the show's Instagram, which <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.instagram.com/p/CaXrazWJkY_/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>wrote</a>: "season two is being filmed right now because of all you who watched."</p><p>Per Netflix, courtesy of Andreeva, here's what to expect from the second season: "Ginny must figure out how to live with the knowledge that her mother is a murderer. Burdened with the new understanding that Kenny—her step-dad—didn’t die of natural causes, now Ginny must deal with the fact that Georgia not only killed, she killed to protect Ginny. Georgia on the other hand would much prefer that the past be left in the past, after all, she’s got a wedding to plan! But the funny thing about Georgia’s past is that it never stays buried for long."</p><h2 id=what-could-season-two-of-xa0-ginny-amp-georgia-xa0-be-about-3>What could season two of&nbsp;Ginny & Georgia&nbsp;be about?</h2><p>The first season <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/a35636738/ginny-and-georgia-ending-explained/>ended</a> on a whole bunch of cliffhangers. Did Ginny and Austin really run away? What's up with Ginny’s relationship with Marcus? Speaking of love, will Georgia’s wedding with the mayor actually happen? Plus, is Georgia getting closer and closer to the clink? We&nbsp;need&nbsp;answers!</p><p>Thankfully, we do have&nbsp;one&nbsp;answer.&nbsp;In an&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://tvline.com/2021/03/07/ginny-and-georgia-season-1-finale-recap-ginny-runs-away/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>interview with&nbsp;TV Line</a>, Gentry cleared up the confusion about where Ginny is going. "When she’s packing her bag, she grabs the book that Zion gives her, and if you were paying attention when Zion arrives and is giving her the book, you know that he included an address. He has that secret coded message in it, and she finds out that it’s his address to his Boston apartment. So I’m thinking it’s pretty reasonable to assume that Ginny might be headed toward Zion."</p><p>The finale also set up the return of Austin's dad in season two. There's so much going on in the finale, you might have missed it—but we never actually find out what Austin is doing when he misses school, and my guess is that his dad has shown up. Plus, we know that Ginny mailed Austin's letters to his dad, which seems to&nbsp;really&nbsp;freak out Georgia. "Did you put our return address on?" she demands of Ginny—but then the storyline gets subsumed by, well, everything else that happens in the final episode.</p><p>Scott Porter, who plays Mayor Paul, teased that there might be more to his straight-laced character than meets the eye,&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=nofollow data-url=https://hollywoodlife.com/2021/05/24/ginny-and-georgia-season-2-scott-porter-reunion-interview/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>telling HollywoodLife:</a>&nbsp;"As far as Mayor Paul goes, I have had questions since day one about where he came from because of the things that he says in the show. He went to Brown. He has an Ivy League education, and then he abandoned all of it to travel overseas, backpack, teach English, and get a sense of the world that is much different than a lot of people who try and fast track their way into politics. But then, upon his return to the States, he magically did that. What drives a person like that? He’s multifaceted, yet very direct and focused. So what made him that way? I’m really excited to discover more about his family and where he came from."</p><p>One thing we do know is that the show will not shy away from portraying diverse characters and (some) relatable situations. One of the best parts about&nbsp;Ginny & Georgia&nbsp;is its refusal to shy away from serious conversations about race, identity, sexuality, and ability. Because Ginny is multiracial in a mostly all-white town, her frustration and inability to fit in is palpable. And her lesbian best friend, Maxine (Sara Waisglass), is shown struggling to date early on in the series as one of the only students at school who’s out. On the other hand, the show also features Maxine’s dad—a deaf character—who spends the entirety of the series just vibing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pv8iCUt9nERNKyJMDVjpkk-1920-80.jpg><p>Gentry has been candid about the show’s dedication to inclusion. In a&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=nofollow data-url=https://www.wmagazine.com/story/antonia-gentry-ginny-and-georgia-interview-new-faces referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>W&nbsp;magazine</a>&nbsp;interview, she said, “When I was growing up, I never saw a biracial lead. I didn’t see interracial couples or narratives often displayed in television or movies, and that was something I didn’t realize I wish I had until later on.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Rebecca Ablack, who plays Padma, told&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=nofollow data-url=https://browngirlmagazine.com/2021/06/rebecca-ablack-the-guyanese-actress-talks-talks-netflixs-ginny-and-georgia-and-indo-caribbean-representation/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Brown Girl Magazine:</a>&nbsp;"The show does a really great job at writing these young characters that are trying to figure out race and sexuality. I resonated with the discussions between these characters that I had at that age...It’s impossible not to resonate with these characters because I am a woman of color living in a world that is built for whiteness.”&nbsp;</p><p>The cast has also&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=nofollow data-url=https://www.etonline.com/ginny-georgia-why-every-gilmore-girls-fan-should-give-this-wildly-addictive-netflix-series-a-chance referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>opened up</a>&nbsp;about the show’s inclusion of ASL. Waisglass learned the language for the show, saying: "The inclusion of ASL was like a magical experience, just on a personal note...We literally got to learn a new language for this role. It's absolutely unbelievable and it is inclusive. I just love that aspect of the show. I thought that was such a great thing."</p><h2 id=what-have-the-cast-and-crew-said-about-season-two-3>What have the cast and crew said about season two?</h2><p>In an interview with&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=nofollow data-url=https://ew.com/tv/ginny-and-georgia-producers-season-1-finale-interview/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Entertainment Weekly,</a>&nbsp;Fisher said, "We want to keep talking about&nbsp;Ginny and Georgia&nbsp;for a very long time." Lampert&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=nofollow data-url=https://www.oprahmag.com/entertainment/tv-movies/a35565449/ginny-and-georgia-season-2-release-date-cast-news/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>said to OprahMag.com:</a>&nbsp;"Season 1 really did feel like a season 1. We just started uncovering some of the layers for all characters, across the board, that we want to dive into."</p><p>In an&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=nofollow data-url=https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a35713496/antonia-gentry-ginny-miller-interview/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>interview with&nbsp;ELLE,</a>&nbsp;Gentry said: "I want to see Ginny get down and dirty. I want to see her turn into Georgia a little bit. I want to see her really dig in and show that mean streak I know she has. That would be really fun to explore."</p><p>In early November of 2021, she shared with <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.seventeen.com/celebrity/a38164282/antonia-gentry-ginny-and-georgia-season-2/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Seventeen</a>: "For season 2, the stakes are much higher now—obviously—than we left off with season 1. So, I think fans will be in for a lot of wonderful tension, a lot of building up to climax, and a couple of interesting characters will be revealed. I can't say a lot about it right now, but I can't wait for us to go back filming, which is very, very soon. I'm just really ready. I miss all my castmates."</p><h2 id=who-apos-s-joining-the-cast-of-ginny-and-georgia-3>Who's joining the cast of Ginny and Georgia?</h2><p>Aaron Ashmore, who you might recall from Locke and Key, has been cast as Austin's dad, Gil—which means that Austin's dad is, presumably, going to show up in Wellsbury to cause all sorts of trouble. So far, iMDB has Gil listed as appearing in all ten episodes of season two, so we know that Gil will play a major role in this season.</p><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.netflix.com/in/title/81025696 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url=https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/100577549/type/dlg/sid/hawk-custom-tracking/https://www.netflix.com/in/title/81025696 data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=netflix.com data-merchant-id=1070 data-merchant-url=netflix.com data-merchant-network=CJ>watch 'ginny & georgia' on netflix</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJulocG2vsRomGxtZmWAeYOSaJ6ipp6ueqK6w2aenqeinLaiedKemKynnmJ%2FbrrErZ2loahk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./13-skinny-jean-outfits-that-will-never-go-out-of-style.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="13 Skinny Jean Outfits That Will Never Go Out of Style">&larr;
