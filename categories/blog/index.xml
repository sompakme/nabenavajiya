There is a $8.95 late payment charge for each missed payment.
Spectrum, like the majority of cable providers, charges a late payment fee, and this is no different. It does, however, provide an unusually lengthy grace period: you have thirty days from the day of your bill’s due date to pay it. After that time period has expired, you will be charged a $8.95 late fee.
Similarly, you may wonder what happens if you don’t pay your spectrum payment on time.</description></item></channel></rss>
