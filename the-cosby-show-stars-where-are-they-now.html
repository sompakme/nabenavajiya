The show, which ran from 1984 until 1992, serves as a comedy classic, launching the careers of many stars.

Long before Bill Cosby was known as a <a href=# rel>reviled sexual predator</a>, the comedian upheld a squeaky-clean image that assisted in normalizing wealth, happiness, and prosperity in black American television. Despite the asterisk placed on Cosby's legacy, the pioneering series' other major stars have all gone on to do great things.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-phylicia-rashad>Phylicia Rashad</h2></span><p>NEWARK, NJ - AUGUST 26: Actress Phylicia Rashad speaks on stage during the 2018 Black Girls Rock! at New Jersey Performing Arts Center on August 26, 2018 in Newark, New Jersey.
