Thankfully through my work as a <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">confidence coach</a>, I had helped many clients with this in the past so had a helpful list of tips and tricks to make the process easier.</p><h2><strong>My top 5 tips to quit drinking</strong></h2><h3><strong>1. Be clear on your 'why'</strong></h3><p id=ewrY8nDzE0tc data-wc=31>This is the most important part of setting and achieving any goal. Having clarity on your motivation for cutting out alcohol is what will keep you going when it gets tough.</p><p id=egd2e5wmEImp data-wc=39>Deciding that you want to complete a fitness challenge or just have enough energy to run around after your grandkids - that’s what will keep you on track (as opposed to just doing something because you feel you should).</p><p id=e0ymmV6yro data-wc=11><strong>DISCOVER:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Biohacking: what is it and can it make you happier?</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h3><strong>2. Find a buddy</strong></h3><p id=ex2znTWXRZtt data-wc=55>Accountability is key when it comes to sticking to your goals. Either find someone who wants to give up (or cut down!) to do it with you, or tell someone close to you that this is your new goal. Having someone to confide in and keep you motivated will ultimately increase your chances of success.</p><h3><strong>3. Be specific and realistic</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3><p id=e1CmFBN83uBn data-wc=73>Are you looking to cut out alcohol completely or just cut down? How long will are you willing to commit to? You have to be clear on your goal and take into account how realistic it might be for you at any given time. It's OK to be flexible and start with small steps – for example, it might be more realistic for you to stop drinking during the week to begin with.</p><h3><strong>4. Make a plan</strong></h3><p id=eaO3veu1V188 data-wc=55>Before a social engagement, it can be really useful to come up with a strategy and know how you're going to approach the event. It's completely up to you whether you want to tell people that you're not drinking, but know that this can open up a line of questioning – and sometimes peer pressure.</p><p id=ehu4RqQ0EYUK data-wc=38>If you're not ready for this, you can easily and discreetly swap your drinks for an <a class=hm-link href=#>alcohol-free alternative</a>. I would often drink soda and lime – without anyone needing to know there was no vodka or gin inside.</p><p id=ePO0fMJgbNj8 data-wc=9><strong>&nbsp;READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>24 of the best alcohol-free and low-alcohol drinks</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h3><strong>5. Persevere</strong></h3><p id=eH8aPEjZd_dD data-wc=41>Cutting out or down on alcohol can be difficult, but the health benefits really do outweigh the initial struggle. Stick with it. Once you notice all areas of your life feeling elevated and overall health improving, it’s hard to look back.</p><p id=eTl2G8rAyKll data-wc=40>I ended up not drinking for three months, and it was the best decision I ever made! You don’t have to do it forever, so why not try it for a couple of weeks and see how you get on?</p><p id=eg5VdoEWNjwh data-wc=15>If you are concerned about your relationship with alcohol then please do&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>seek professional help</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaJ%2BemZyptW6tzZ1kn6Gko7K0v45tcGxuZWp8orjCqJ%2BopF2bv6axjK2fq52VYrqwutOhqmarm567brTAqaeippWowHA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./inside-the-complex-campy-costumes-of-poor-things.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Inside the Complex, Campy Costumes of &amp;quot;Poor Things&amp;quot;">&larr;
