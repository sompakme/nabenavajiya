While these fictionalized works have undoubtedly taken liberties with the real-world details of their subject matter, with some painting more factually accurate pictures than others (The Queen, for instance, is far more rooted in history than, say,&nbsp;The Princess Diaries), there’s something intriguing about the pressures and privileges of the crown that these films explore. Without further ado, here are movies to watch for a glimpse behind the curtain of the monarchy.</p><h2 id=x2018-the-king-x2019-s-speech-x2019-3>‘The King’s Speech’</h2><p>Nominated for a whopping 12 <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/oscars/>Oscars</a> at the 83rd Academy Awards and winning four, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Colin Firth’s poignant turn as King George IV,&nbsp;The King’s Speech&nbsp;was a major success upon its 2010 release. In it, we see the true story of the monarch, who&nbsp;suffered from an impenetrable stammer, working with a speech and language therapist to overcome his disorder as he prepares to make a national speech declaring war on Nazi Germany. With Helena Bonham Carter in a supporting role as Queen Elizabeth, the film gives a riveting look at the private battles being fought by the ruler behind the scenes of one of the biggest turning points in history.</p><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel="sponsored noopener" data-url=https://www.amazon.com/Kings-Speech-Colin-Firth/dp/B004R36QUE/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=141596&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FKings-Speech-Colin-Firth%2Fdp%2FB004R36QUE%2F%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dhawk-custom-tracking-20" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name="Amazon US" data-merchant-id=1471 data-merchant-url=amazon.com data-merchant-network=Amazon>Watch on Amazon Prime</a></p><h2 id=x2018-grace-of-monaco-apos-3>‘Grace of Monaco'</h2><p>“I don’t know how I’m going to spend the rest of my life in this place where I can’t be me,” Grace Kelly (Nicole Kidman) whispers to her trusted confidant, Father Francis Tucker (Frank Langella), at the height of her despair. The American movie star upended her whole life in the states and gave up her career to become Princess Grace of Monaco, wife to Prince Rainier III, but it doesn't go how she had hoped. Everything she says and does seems to be wrong, her new husband is cold and distant, and she misses things back home. While it’s unclear whether such a conversation between the two actually took place, other real-life friends of Kelly’s hinted at her initial unhappiness in her new life. "I am sure there were times in the early years when she felt somewhat like a prisoner in a gilded cage behind the palace walls," said Joan Dale, Kelly’s closest friend,&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=nofollow data-url=https://www.independent.ie/style/celebrity/celebrity-features/article38032531.ece referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>in an excerpt from her book</a>,&nbsp;My Days With Princess Grace of Monaco.

Set in the days following Diana’s death in 1997, the film explores the inner workings of the monarchy as its highest-ranking members decide what role, if any, they are to play in the public mourning of the departed princess. Having been stripped of her formal Her Royal Highness title following her&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a36842801/princess-diana-royal-family-divorce-bbc-interview/>divorce&nbsp;from Prince Charles</a> one year prior, Diana was no longer considered a member of the royal family. Queen <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/queen-elizabeth-ii/>Elizabeth II</a> (Mirren), therefore, believes she owes the public little in the way of an acknowledgment of her ex-daughter-in-law’s demise and is averse to a public funeral service. Though liberties were taken from the real-life story (in the film, it’s up to then-Prime Minister Tony Blair, as played by Michael Sheen, to change her mind, and ultimately, save the monarchy) some of the film's plot was&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=nofollow data-url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/prince-philip-tony-blair-alastair-campbell-princess-diana-funeral-prince-william-prince-harry-a7903186.html referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>likely rooted in truth</a>.

But don’t be fooled. It not only loosely documents the life of the late Queen of France as recounted by Antonia Frazer from her <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=nofollow data-url=https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/55797/marie-antoinette-by-antonia-fraser/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>biographical work of the same name</a>, but it also reminds the viewer of the tender age at which she took the throne—19—and the unending scrutiny that came along with her title. “It's kind of like a history of feelings, rather than a history of facts,” star Kirsten Dunst <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=nofollow data-url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/oct/08/features.review1 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>said of the film</a>.

It’s the second film,&nbsp;Harry & Meghan: Becoming Royal, that takes on a whole new meaning in the light of the real-life duo’s televised sit-down with Oprah, however. The film touches on Meghan’s desire to retain her voice and her sense of self while adjusting to her new role within the royal family; Harry’s unwavering support of his new bride; and the unrelenting ridicule they faced together in the public eye. It’s a sympathetic look at the pair’s experiences which seems eerily in line with details from their interview—despite being released nearly two years prior.</p><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=nofollow data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IhjYEJ-wHA" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Watch on YouTube</a></p><h2 id=x2018-the-duchess-x2019-3>‘The Duchess’</h2><p>Long before <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/diana/>Princess Diana</a>, Duchess Kate, and Duchess Meghan were captivating the world with their royal love affairs, it was Diana’s great-great-great-great aunt, Georgiana Spencer, who had tongues wagging with her union to William Cavendish, the Duke of Devonshire. Depicted by Keira Knightley in 2008’s&nbsp;The Duchess, Spencer, who came to power in the late 18th century, wasn’t exactly blessed with a fairytale marriage—far from.

There, he meets Paige (Julia Stiles), who opens him up to everything he’s been missing out on. It’s not all doves and roses for the fledgling couple, however; they still must win over Edvard’s disapproving parents, King Harald and Queen Rosalind. The film's poignant themes of longing for escape from the obligations of public service and feeling "trapped" are likely ones Prince Harry himself could relate to.

In doing so, they change their fates forever, as well as those of their love interests, one of whom just so happens to be a crowned prince.

While she has been portrayed in several films and television adaptations throughout the years, it was 1998’s&nbsp;Elizabeth, which featured Cate Blanchett as the leading lady, that would perhaps become the most acclaimed. Though Elizabeth I managed to establish Protestantism during her reign, champion the arts, and bring peace to her then-tumultuous country, her worth was reduced by many of her subjects to what was seen as a failure to wed and produce a royal heir. In the end, it was her rival, Queen Mary of Scots, that would birth the next King of England, James IV of Scotland. With&nbsp;Elizabeth, however, Blanchett managed to restore some of the historical figure’s power, proclaiming herself a bride of England and ruling as “the virgin queen.”</p><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel="sponsored noopener" data-url=https://www.amazon.com/Elizabeth-Cate-Blanchett/dp/B0026IQYEA referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=141596&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FElizabeth-Cate-Blanchett%2Fdp%2FB0026IQYEA%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dhawk-custom-tracking-20" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name="Amazon US" data-merchant-id=1471 data-merchant-url=amazon.com data-merchant-network=Amazon>Watch on Amazon Prime</a></p><h2 id=x2018-the-young-victoria-x2019-3>‘The Young Victoria’</h2><p>Queen Victoria, who served as the Queen of the United Kingdom of Britain and Ireland for 63 years, was no shrinking violet.

Be careful who you trust—especially when you’re a ruling monarch. A war film based on Shakespeare’s dramatized account of King Henry V’s rule, this Netflix adaptation sees star Timothée Chalamet being begrudgingly drawn into the final stages of the Hundred Years’ War at the urging of those in his court. While he would be remembered as one of the greatest warrior kings of medieval England, in the film he accepts his role with reluctance—something that differed from the king’s real-life demeanor. According to the history books, the real Henry V believed himself to be “divinely ordained to carry out God’s great work,” which could only be achieved through a <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=nofollow data-url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/true-story-henry-v-englands-warrior-king-180973432/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>show of military force</a>.</p><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel="sponsored noopener" data-url=https://www.netflix.com/watch/80182016? referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url=https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/100577549/type/dlg/sid/hawk-custom-tracking/https://www.netflix.com/watch/80182016? data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=netflix.com data-merchant-id=1070 data-merchant-url=netflix.com data-merchant-network=CJ>Watch on Netflix</a></p><h2 id=x2018-the-girl-king-x2019-3>‘The Girl King’</h2><p>Queen Christina, née Kristina Augusta, rose to power in the 17th century, having succeeded her father, Gustavus Adolphus, at just six years old. Having reportedly read about England’s “virgin queen” Elizabeth I, Queen Christina shocked her kingdom by doing the same, refusing to take a suitor as her husband. Her journey— which was once portrayed by screen siren Greta Garbo in the 1933 film&nbsp;Queen Christina—was recreated for the silver screen once more with 2015’s&nbsp;The Girl King. This adaptation more closely explores her non-conformist relationship with gender and her rumored sexual affairs with her closest friend, Ebba Sparre. It also recounts the events that led the Swedish ruler to convert from Lutheranism to Catholicism and abdicate her throne in 1654 to her cousin, Charles Gustav.</p><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel="sponsored noopener" data-url=https://www.hulu.com/movie/the-girl-king-0a988f5c-629e-40c3-b5cb-8debca1712b7 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=skimlinks data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1662120&xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hulu.com%2Fmovie%2Fthe-girl-king-0a988f5c-629e-40c3-b5cb-8debca1712b7&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marieclaire.com%2Fculture%2Fg35788334%2Fbest-royal-movies" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name="SkimLinks - hulu.com" data-merchant-id=undefined data-merchant-url=undefined data-merchant-network=undefined>Watch on Hulu</a></p><h2 id=apos-coming-to-america-apos-3>'Coming to America'</h2><p>Eddie Murphy is at his best in this hilarious comedy about fictional Prince Akeem Joffer of fictional kingdom of Zamunda searching for a wife who can "arouse [his] intellect as well as [his] loins." To find such a woman, Akeem and his best friend Semmi (Arsenio Hall) travel to the United States, specifically Queens, NY, where they get jobs at a fast-food restaurant in order to spend more time wooing woman of his dreams.

Before you scoff at the inclusion of this feel-good Disney classic, hear us out. Sure, heroine Mia Thermopolis (<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/anne-hathaway/>Anne Hathaway</a> in her breakout role) is completely made-up, but a quick refresher of this early aughts film proves that many of the protocols and behaviors the teen is forced to adopt as an heir to the fictional kingdom of Genovia ring rather true as far as royalty goes. For Mia, it’s not enough to simply don a tiara and shine her inner light. Rather, her grandmother, Queen Clarisse of Genovia (Julie Andrews), sets out to mold her into someone more worthy of the crown. With rule after rule to learn (“Princesses never cross their legs in public,” Queen Clarisse declares), Mia is ultimately forced to choose between her life of normalcy and her newfound imperial duties. (Sounds … familiar, no?)</p><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel="sponsored noopener" data-url=https://www.amazon.com/Princess-Diaries-Anne-Hathaway/dp/B0060CSLKS/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=141596&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FPrincess-Diaries-Anne-Hathaway%2Fdp%2FB0060CSLKS%2F%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dhawk-custom-tracking-20" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name="Amazon US" data-merchant-id=1471 data-merchant-url=amazon.com data-merchant-network=Amazon>Watch on Amazon Prime</a></p><h2 id=apos-the-princess-diaries-2-royal-engagement-apos-3>'The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement'</h2><p>So long as you're watching Princess Diaries, you might as well cue up the sequel. In the adorable follow-up a post-college Princess Mia returns to Genovia only to find out that an antiquated rule requires her to marry before she can ascend to the throne—and another Genovian is plotting to take the crown. While most real-life modern royal families don't follow such sexist requirements anymore, the British royal family did only change the line of succession so that <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/princess-charlotte/>Princess Charlotte</a> would remain ahead of her little brother, Louis. The flick keeps it all lighthearted, rom-com antics ensue, and a dashing young prince William is even floated as a husband option.

And while we know ol' Hank liked to sleep around (he had six wives and many mistresses, remember), that may be one of the few historically accurate aspects of this film. The movie, based on the book of the same name by Philippa Gregory, centers on Henry's real-life second wife, Anne Boleyn, and her sister Mary, with whom he was also romantically involved. Although some major plot points are fuzzy (it's not confirmed by historians that Mary's son was Henry's, and all that incest stuff is questionable), what's definitely true is that this love triangle was filled with deceit, revenge, and, eventually, beheading.</p><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel="sponsored noopener" data-url=https://www.hulu.com/movie/the-other-boleyn-girl-78f6259f-30aa-4da3-a457-d5a3619dbeeb referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=skimlinks data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1662120&xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hulu.com%2Fmovie%2Fthe-other-boleyn-girl-78f6259f-30aa-4da3-a457-d5a3619dbeeb&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marieclaire.com%2Fculture%2Fg35788334%2Fbest-royal-movies" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name="SkimLinks - hulu.com" data-merchant-id=undefined data-merchant-url=undefined data-merchant-network=undefined>Watch it on Hulu</a></p><h2 id=apos-shakespeare-in-love-apos-3>'Shakespeare in Love'</h2><p>Okay, this one is really about William Shakespeare and how he came to write his masterpiece&nbsp;Romeo and Juliet, but it does star Dame Judi Dench as Queen Elizabeth I. There's some hubbub about whether the person playing Juliet is a woman (outlawed!) or a man. Spoiler alert: It's a woman, Viola de Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow), pretending to be a man so that she can act. Elizabeth realizes this but allows the charade to continue as she "knows something of a woman in a man's profession."

The real-life scandal changed the country in many ways, as Queen Caroline and Struensee were both Enlightenment thinkers that enacted several progressive reforms.

It's often compared to Hamlet, with prince Simba growing into a capable leader after his uncle kills his father and assumes the throne. Behind songs like "I Just Can't Wait to Be King" and "He Lives in You" is a kid-friendly tale about embracing a legacy and taking responsibility as a monarch. Plus, if you just can't see the cartoon as an epic drama, the live-action remake gives an extra dose of realism (and Beyoncé as a voice actor).&nbsp;</p><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.disneyplus.com/video/87982e2b-5636-41a2-9d9a-5bc77cacb7d7?distributionPartner=google" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/221109/564546/9358?subId1=hawk-custom-tracking&sharedId=hawk-prefix&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fvideo%2F87982e2b-5636-41a2-9d9a-5bc77cacb7d7%3FdistributionPartner%3Dgoogle" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=disneyplus.com data-merchant-id=128540 data-merchant-url=disneyplus.com data-merchant-network=ImpactRad>Watch on Disney+</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJulocG2vsRonmxtZ22FdH%2BTaJmeq6Riv7DFwKVkpqemnrK0ew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./the-truth-about-david-and-patricia-arquette-s-unusual-childhood.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Truth About David And Patricia Arquette's Unusual Childhood">&larr;
