Because of the patient’s existing benefit plan, certain services are not covered.</p><p></p><h3>What does the code PR204 mean?</h3><p>A PR-204 indicates that the service/equipment/drug in question is not covered by the patient’s current insurance plan.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>What does the number OA 121 mean?</h3><p>A4: The code OA-121 refers to a patient who owes money on an outstanding debt.</p><p></p><h3>What does a rejection of OA 23 imply?</h3><p>Claim Adjustment Reason Codes are related with an adjustment, which means that they must indicate the reason why a claim or service line was paid in a different manner than it was originally invoiced. The effect of past payer(s) adjudication, including payments and/or changes, is shown on the OA-23 form.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>What is the meaning of rejection code Co 97?</h3><p>As a result, the evaluation and management services that are related to surgery performed during the post-operative period will be denied as CO 97 – The benefit for this service is included in the payment or allowance for another service or procedure that has already been adjudicated – will be denied.</p><p></p><h3>What does the number PR 119 mean?</h3><p>Reason for Refusal, Reason/Remark Code (s) APR-119 indicates that the benefit limit for this time period or event has been reached.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>What are the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) codes?</h3><p>Codes assigned by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) to identify geographic entities across all federal government departments are known as American National Standards Institute codes (ANSI codes).</p><p></p><h3>What is a big medical adjustment, and how does it happen?</h3><p>noun. Insurance intended to compensate for unusually high medical expenditures incurred as a result of a severe or lengthy sickness, often by paying a high proportion of medical bills in excess of a certain threshold.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>What is Medicare adjustment code CO 237 and how does it work?</h3><p>CO-237 – Penalty for Violation of Legislation or Regulation.
