Her parents were Michael, a minister, and Evelyn Braxton. The Braxtons was a strict, religious family who forbade engagement with popular culture. Toni, together with her four younger sisters, began singing at their father’s church at a tender age.</p><p>Progressively, Michael and Evelyn relaxed their household rules; this allowed their daughters more introduction to soul and rock singers, such as <strong>Stevie Wonder</strong> and <strong>Chaka Khan</strong>.Toni in particular made music the central part of her life. She participated in many local talent shows and collaborated with her sisters on many occasions.</p><p><strong>Toni Braxton</strong> had planned to become a music teacher after graduating from high school. She was, however, persuaded to abandon college by songwriter <strong>Bill Pettaway</strong>. Pettaway had overheard Toni singing to herself at a gas station.</p><p>Pettaway, who had just written Milli Vanilli's “Girl You Know It’s True” was captivated by Toni’s husky, driving voice. Pettaway was instrumental in helping Toni and her sisters land recording contracts with <strong>Arista Records</strong>.</p><h2>Early Acclaim</h2><p>In 1990, the sisters calling themselves <strong>‘The Braxtons’</strong>&nbsp;released the single <strong>“The Good Life.”</strong> The single was not a huge success, but it managed to prick the ears of producers Antonio ‘L.A’ Reid and Kenneth ‘Babyface’ Edmonds.

In 1998 she filed for bankruptcy.</p><p>advertisement</p><p>advertisement</p><h2>Stagecraft and Film Roles</h2><p><strong>Toni Braxton</strong> got into acting and became the first black actress to play “Belle” in a Broadway production of the acclaimed <strong>“Beauty and the Beast.”</strong> This song turned into a monster hit and chart mover.</p><p>In 2000, after three years of legal wrangling, Braxton managed to release her third album, titled “The Heat.” This album featured Braxton as bold as opposed to heartbroken. It had singles such as “Just be a Man About it.”</p><p>Toni produced her fourth album “More than a Woman” in 2002 and after that was signed on to Background records. “Libra” was her fifth album and this was released in the year 2005.</p><p>In 2010 she released her sixth and last album, “Pulse.” Braxton decided to stop cutting albums and concentrated on other projects.
