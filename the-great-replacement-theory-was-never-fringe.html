Scott Fitzgerald classic many years ago. In it, Tom Buchanan—an old-money socialite and notorious bully married to Nick Carraway's cousin Daisy—"violently" expresses his pessimism for the future. "If we don't look out," the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/politics/a12014607/white-liberals-response-white-supremacy/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="white race is at risk" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">white race is at risk</a> of being "utterly submerged," he says.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It is this same decades-old belief that, four days ago, animated an 18-year-old white man to drive three hours to a supermarket in a Black neighborhood in Buffalo, New York, and open fire. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/politics/a40021130/buffalo-shooting-how-to-help/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ten people were killed and three hurt" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Ten people were killed and three hurt</a> in the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/politics/a26885218/why-gun-violence-is-a-womens-issue-moms-demand-action-for-gun-sense-america/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=shooting class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">shooting</a> on May 14—11 of them Black, by no coincidence.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In a 180-page screed posted online, the alleged gunman, Payton Gendron, justified his <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a38094736/americas-black-maternal-health-crisis/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="racist violence" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">racist violence</a>: The white race is "doomed," he wrote, because of declining white birth rates and the increase in immigrants and non-whites in the United States. Gendron's carefully planned violence was meant to put a dent in the inevitable "crisis" that he claimed is the "racial and cultural replacement of the European people."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Much of the early news coverage of the shooting described these views as "fringe"—aberrations that have crept out of the darkest corners of the Internet into the mainstream in recent years. But, as the Gatsby reference demonstrates, they are neither new, nor fringe. They are not the beliefs of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/05/lone-wolf-shooters-ideology/629871/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action='a one-off "lone wolf."' class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60"><u>a one-off "lone wolf."</u></a> They are also not foreign ideas that have seeped into the American consciousness. These beliefs are part of a distinctly home-grown ideology, one that throughout the history of the United States has been promoted by some of the most powerful bureaucrats, senators, presidents, and journalists. It has, for much of this history, fueled a coordinated movement in pursuit of global white supremacy, churned out an unending cycle of violence, and shaped lasting policy.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This "Great Replacement Theory" was particularly in vogue when The Great Gatsby was written. The fact that Buchanan attributes it to a book called The Rise of the Colored Empires by "this man Goddard" is no accident of imagination. Some scholars <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.jstor.org/stable/27553049 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=guess class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60"><u>guess</u></a> that "Goddard" is a portmanteau clubbing together the last names of two extremely influential thinkers in the early-20th century: Madison Grant and Theodore Lothrop Stoddard.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Grant was born into a blue-blooded New York family. As a youth, he spent his time off from private school either at his family's estate in Long Island or traveling the world. As an adult, he graduated from Yale University and obtained a law degree from Columbia University. He wore many hats. Apart from running his own law practice in Manhattan, he was an anthropologist and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://images.library.amnh.org/digital/index.php/items/show/55985 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="trustee of the American Museum of Natural History" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60"><u>trustee of the American Museum of Natural History</u></a>, a zoologist who served as chairman of the New York Zoological Society, and an environmentalist who apparently helped think up the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2016/07/anniversary-national-parks-racist-history-madison-grant/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="concept of national parks" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60"><u>concept of national parks</u></a>. He was, of course, also a racist and eugenicist. In 1916, he authored The Passing of the Great Race, in which he claimed the superiority of the "Nordic" race and painted immigrants and Jewish people as "inferior" "social discards" overrunning his city.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">His book elevated outlandish ideas about race science and eugenics that had <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2567407 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="already been gaining steam" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60"><u>already been gaining steam</u></a>. As Adam Serwer <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/04/adam-serwer-madison-grant-white-nationalism/583258/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=explains class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60"><u>explains</u></a> in The Atlantic, "The eugenic focus on winnowing out unfit individuals made way for a more sweeping crusade to defend against contagion by inferior races. By Grant's logic, infection meant obliteration."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Indeed, Grant was prominently featured in the publications of the day, including The Saturday Evening Post and The New York Times, and had many friends who amplified his ideas in Washington. In 1917, then ex-president Theodore Roosevelt <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://eugenics.us/theodore-roosevelt-on-madison-grants-the-passing-of-the-great-race/306.htm data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=praised class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">praised</a> The Passing of the Great Race as "a capital book" in Scribner's magazine; a few years later, in 1921, then vice president Calvin Coolidge <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/03/opinion/sunday/anti-immigrant-hatred-1920s.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=echoed class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60"><u>echoed</u></a> Grant's ideas in an article for Good Housekeeping. When it was later translated into German, Grant's book <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www-jstor-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/stable/42628761?seq=15" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action='became Adolf Hitler&#39;s "bible."' class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60"><u>became Adolf Hitler's "bible."</u></a></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Grant’s ideology bred other ideologues. His protégé, Stoddard, wrote his own version of a manifesto, The Rising Tide of Color Against White World-Supremacy, the title of which closely mirrors the book Buchanan references in The Great Gatsby. Stoddard was also a member of the American Eugenics Society, and, as it was later revealed in a news exposé, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://perspectives.ushmm.org/item/lothrop-stoddard-in-a-eugenics-court data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the Ku Klux Klan" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60"><u>the Ku Klux Klan</u></a>. Stoddard was also obsessed with the idea that Jews had controlled the Bolshevik Revolution, transforming the prospect of racial replacement from a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/804146/pdf data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action='passive state ("race suicide") to an active, violent threat' class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60"><u>passive state ("race suicide") to an active, violent threat</u></a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Later, Henry Ford was among the prominent Americans who amplified this same conspiracy theory in a widely circulated weekly pamphlet of The Dearborn Independent, along with translated English excerpts of anti-Semitic propaganda, called the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.facinghistory.org/weimar-republic-fragility-democracy/society/protocols-elders-zion-1927-society-antisemitism data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Protocols of the Elders of Zion" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60"><u>Protocols of the Elders of Zion</u></a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The "Great Replacement Theory" influenced a number of laws in the early-20th century (including those on anti-miscegenation and segregation), but perhaps none as successfully as those controlling immigration. As immigration historian Reece Jones <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/28/opinion/race-immigration-racism.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=writes class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60"><u>writes</u></a> in The New York Times, the race-based exclusions of the era were an explicit attempt, as Roosevelt <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.bartleby.com/268/10/29.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="himself put it" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60"><u>himself put it</u></a>, to prevent "race suicide." The fear of this demographic death led the country to first limit the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/immigration/gentlemens-agreement data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="entry of Japanese immigrants" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60"><u>entry of Japanese immigrants</u></a>, then <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://immigrationhistory.org/item/1917-barred-zone-act/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="people from the Middle East and Southeast Asia" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60"><u>people from the Middle East and Southeast Asia</u></a>, and finally, anyone who wasn't a particular stock of white.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 1924, Congress passed the Johnson-Reed Act, a sweeping law that instituted quotas for immigration on the basis of national origin and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://immigrationhistory.org/item/1924-immigration-act-johnson-reed-act/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=barred class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60"><u>barred</u></a> immigrants outside of Western Europe from coming to the United States. The bureaucratic process detailed in the law, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2567407 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="as historian Mae Ngai explains" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60"><u>as historian Mae Ngai explains</u></a>, was heavily shaped by the chair of the Senate Immigration Committee, David Reed of Pennsylvania, and the lobbyist <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_B._Trevor_Sr. data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="John Bond Trevor" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60"><u>John Bond Trevor</u></a>, who was a colleague of Madison Grant.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 1965, on the heels of the Civil Rights Act, these exclusionary quotas were abolished and a new system of colorblind numerical limits on immigration was put in place. Even then, lawmakers made robust efforts to appease nativists, making sure that family-based immigration would be one of the main pathways to citizenship so that the relatives of white Americans would be favored. In a debate on the legislation at the time, Massachusetts senator Edward "Ted" Kennedy, a Democrat, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/news/immigration-act-1965-changes data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="reassured his peers" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60"><u>reassured his peers</u></a>. "The bill will not flood our cities with immigrants," he said. "It will not upset the ethnic mix of our society."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">He was wrong. The 1965 immigration overhaul <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.whatitmeanstobeamerican.org/ideas/the-contradictory-legacy-of-the-1965-immigration-act/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="had many unintended consequences" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60"><u>had many unintended consequences</u></a>, but it certainly did <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/fifty-years-1965-immigration-and-nationality-act-continues-reshape-united-states data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="diversify the U.S. population" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60"><u>diversify the U.S. population</u></a>. With that demographic change in America and other Western nations in the second half of the 20th century rose a new contingent of anti-immigrant crusaders who revived fears of the "great replacement." In the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/17/opinion/buffalo-shooting-replacement-theory.html?referringSource=articleShare" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=NYT class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60"><u>NYT</u></a>, Dr. Kathleen Belew, the author of Bring the War Home: The White Power Movement and Paramilitary America, attributes the more recent popularity of the concept to two texts: The Camp of the Saints by Jean Raspail—a 1973 dystopian novel in which Europeans are violently replaced by people of color—and The Great Replacement by Renaud Camus, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/20/world/europe/renaud-camus-great-replacement.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="a French writer" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60"><u>a French writer</u></a> responsible for the pithy modern repackaging of the "Great Replacement Theory."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In America, the post-1960s crop of nativists built on the tactics inherited from their forefathers in the 1920s, focusing their rhetoric and policy <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://newrepublic.com/article/163891/immigrant-refugee-ceilings data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="on apolitical-seeming numbers instead of race" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60"><u>on apolitical-seeming numbers instead of race</u></a>. Key among them was <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/17/us/17immig.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="John Tanton" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60"><u>John Tanton</u></a>, an ophthalmologist from Michigan who advocated for immigration restrictions as a way of, among other things, controlling the effect of overpopulation on the environment. Tanton corresponded with Klan members and dabbled in eugenicist ideas. But his lasting legacy was the network of <strong>nativist</strong> groups he helped create, including the Federation for American Immigration Reform, Center for Immigration Studies, and NumbersUSA, which continue to lobby the government.These organizations bill themselves as advocates of immigration restrictions simply as a matter of good policy, even though their policy goals appear to stem from racial anxieties and yield racial consequences. For instance, Jones, the immigration historian, recently <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth=NotApplicable data-linkindex=2 data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://twitter.com/ReeceJonesUH/status/1526252132600492032?s=20&t=usmZ0skb9S3ZvXY2Obxpvw" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="pointed out on Twitter" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">pointed out on Twitter</a> that the logo of NumbersUSA is derived from a graph representing the "great replacement" that the group's founder included in his 1996 book, The Case Against Immigration.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Federation for American Immigration Reform and Center for Immigration Studies, which the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth=NotApplicable data-linkindex=1 data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/john-tanton data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action='Southern Poverty Law Center has deemed "hate groups,"' class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Southern Poverty Law Center has deemed "hate groups,"</a> regularly testify as neutral subject-matter experts in Congress and are quoted as such in news coverage, as does NumbersUSA.
