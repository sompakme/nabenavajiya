That's when you see a gorgeous person change into a shabby-looking person because he/she got dumped by a man she thought would take her to the altar.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/5a1614f43778f462.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>"Trust nobody": Portable laments over robbery at his studio, shows its bad state, fans advise him</span></p></a><p class=align-left>For some, it could lead to low self-esteem and then depression and then some begin to contemplate ending it all. That's what happens when they are still so fragile, weak, and unable to put themselves first. Especially for first-time lovers.</p><h2>Can heartbreak be healed?</h2><p class=align-left>Of course, it <a href=#>can</a> and very fast too if you are ready. My last failed relationship before I got married took only four days to heal. Some people move on immediately after they drop that breakup call. They just say 'okay it's over' and move on. Especially the experienced ones in relationships.</p><p class=align-left>They no longer go into relationships with the mindset that 'it is forever'. No. They bear in mind that anything can happen and when it does, I should find a new path. That's how to survive in a <a href=#>world</a> of uncertainties.</p><p class=align-left>It doesn't mean you won't love the person. You should love with all your heart and care for your lover but guard your heart while at it. And most importantly love yourself.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/8c8ca1f1cd065c08.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>"She has children": Nigerian widow faints while begging for pure water, unable to feed kids</span></p></a><p class=align-left>You can heal in even one week if you put your mind to it. Although it might not be the case with everyone but trust me, you don't need to waste three long months crying over a person who doesn't need you. It's all in the mind. Love yourself and be ready to prove it with your actions. There's no limit to what a person can do once you are ready.</p><p class=align-left>Before beginning any therapy, I always ask my clients 'are you ready to do what is necessary?' cause most times you give an instruction and they refuse to do it because they still crave the attachment to someone they want to forget.</p><p class=align-left>How can that work? You need to take a definite stand. That's the first process of healing. Be sure you want to break free and be determined if not you cannot achieve that.</p><h2>Block all contact; first step to heal</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b93deb40bf642ad0.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>"Don't leave me": Unhappy man breaks up with lover on valentine's day via WhatsApp</span></p></a><p class=align-left>After a severe heartbreak, I always advise my clients to block all contact with this person first, delete numbers and focus on yourself. It's not hard if you have healthy self-esteem and love yourself.</p><p class=align-left>The problem is people want to forget a person and heal but they're not ready to do what it takes. You tell them 'delete his number' and they say no I can't do that. My heart can't take it. So why did you come to me? I'm a therapist, not a magician.</p><p class=align-left>A client told me she can't delete his number because she thinks he would call back and she still wants to watch his WhatsApp status to be sure he's fine. But you want to heal from this person. Why are you doing this to yourself? Why are you still hanging on? You need to help yourself too.</p><p class=align-left>You can't remain in contact and be hoping to heal fast from a heartbreak. The first-timers are always the most affected because they place everything about them on the relationship. Their heart, body and soul. Now they feel their world is falling apart.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1bf515bcd6ba4e83.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Baker who spent all her savings on Valentine's Day packages in tears as no one buys from her</span></p></a><h2>Build yourself, focus on improving your self-esteem</h2><p class=align-left>Focus your attention towards building healthy self-esteem and learning to set standards and boundaries for yourself.</p><p class=align-left>Those with low self-esteem suffer so much heartbreak because they always blame themselves even when it's glaring that their lovers are the evil ones.</p><p class=align-left>They just believe it was their fault. They want to beg this person for forgiveness at all times. It doesn't work that way. Don't judge yourself so negatively. Be kind to yourself.</p><p class=align-left>Being in love doesn't mean you should be so fragile. You can love and still set healthy standards and boundaries for yourself.</p><p class=align-left>This is the reason I don't advise people especially ladies with low self-esteem to get into relationships. It's always a mess. Build your self-esteem and understand yourself before going into a relationship. Know what you want and what you don't. Don't succumb to everything your partner wants because he wants it even if it's killing you. That's not healthy because the day you don't do what he says, there will be a huge problem.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e625a02646cbd410.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>"I honestly have not regretted my decision": Lady who moved to Nigeria after years in Germany speaks</span></p></a><h2>Focus on yourself, get new hobbies</h2><p class=align-left>Focusing on your hobbies and interests is a great way to let go of whoever made you cry. Make sure you have blocked contact and try not to think about this person. It won't help you. Once he crosses your mind, shove that feeling off.</p><p class=align-left>That thing you've always wanted to do, that hobby you want, it's time to focus on it.
