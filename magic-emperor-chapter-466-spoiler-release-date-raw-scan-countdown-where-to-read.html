The emperor then welcomed the Quanrong leader, Tuoba Liufeng, as his guest of honor, and explained his plan to his sons, the crown prince and the second prince.</p><p>The emperor revealed that he had sacrificed a tenth of the nation’s land to the Quanrong, in exchange for their help in eliminating the seven houses. He justified his decision by saying that he wanted to restore the glory of the Yuwen clan and that he had no choice but to use the Quanrong since the seven houses were too powerful and influential. He also said that he had kept this information secret and that anyone who leaked it would be executed.</p><p>The emperor’s daughter, Yongning, was disgusted by her father’s actions and called him vile and treasonous. She stormed out of the palace, leaving her father and brothers behind. The emperor then asked his sons what they thought of his plan, and they both expressed their support and admiration. The emperor then asked them if they knew who Tianyu belonged to, and they answered that it belonged to the emperor.</p><p>The emperor corrected them and said that Tianyu belonged to the Yuwen clan and that he was only a temporary ruler. He said that the previous generations of emperors had tried to reclaim Tianyu from the seven houses, but failed. He said that he had finally succeeded and that he had a bigger goal in mind: to unify the entire continent under his rule.</p><p>The emperor then revealed that he had another reason for using the Quanrong: to lure out his enemy, the magic emperor, who was hiding in the mortal realm. He said that he knew the magic emperor’s true identity and that he had been waiting for him to return. He then looked at the sky, where a dark cloud formed, and smiled.</p><p>Meanwhile, Zhuo Yifan, who was flying in the sky with his dragon, sensed the emperor’s presence and intention. He realized that the emperor was his brother and that he was the final boss of the series. He also realized that the emperor had used the Quanrong to kill the seven houses and that he had sacrificed a tenth of the nation’s land to them. He was furious and disgusted and decided to confront his brother and stop his evil plan.</p><p>Zhuo Yifan then flew towards the palace, where the emperor was waiting for him. The two brothers then met face to face and exchanged a cold and hostile gaze. The chapter ended with the emperor saying, “Welcome back, brother.”</p><p><strong>Read Also: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Magic Emperor Chapter 456 Spoilers, Release Date</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Where_to_Read></span>Where to Read<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>You can read Magic Emperor chapter 466 on the web platform Tapas, the authorized publisher of the manhua in English.
