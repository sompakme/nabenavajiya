I needed to get out of my comfort zone, I needed to go into a very unknown place."</p><p>That's exactly what Williams seems to have found in Take Me Out.</p><p>He leads the cast as a bi-racial, gay baseball player set in the mid-1990s, who decides to come out.</p><p>"It’s a play about race, class, <a href=#>sexuality</a>, sport, and living a life in the public eye," the profile reads.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More On The Sun">Read More On The Sun</h2><p>&nbsp;"The role is also a way for Williams to explore some of his own contradictions."</p><p>"Like what it means to be a deep thinker admired for his body, to be a Black celebrity in majority white spaces, to live both public life and a private one."</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The US Sun team?</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hqaGl%2FcoWUaK6hp12fsrS%2FxGauoqScnq6uv44%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-the-smartest-in-haikyuu.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is the smartest in Haikyuu?">&larr;
