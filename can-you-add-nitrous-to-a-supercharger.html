Nitrous is easily the best bang for the buck horsepower investment you could make. Either path will get you where you want to go—quickly.<h2>How much HP will nitrous add?</h2>If you're wondering what's the easiest and cheapest way to add a lot of horsepower to your engine, then we have the answer: nitrous oxide. Yep, for less than $500 you can add 100 to 200 hp to your engine using common hand tools and without breaking a sweat.<h2>Can you have nitrous and ProCharger?</h2>There's been a lot of customers put nitrous on along with their ProCharger and has had great results. You can add nitrous a few different ways- through a TB plate, a direct port, or a single nozzle.<h2>How much HP can you add with a supercharger?</h2>Supercharger or turbocharger<p>A turbocharger works with the exhaust system and can potentially give you gains of 70-150 horsepower. A supercharger is connected directly to the engine intake and could provide an extra 50-100 horsepower.</p><h2>CHEAP JUNKYARD BOOST PLUS NITROUS-HOW TO ADD NITROUS TO YOUR (OTHER GUYS) SUPERCHARGED L67 3800 V6</h2><p></p><h2>How can I add more power to my supercharger?</h2>A supercharger (like a turbocharger) works by compressing an engine's airflow before it actually enters the engine. By adding more air, the engine can also mix in more fuel, which results in a bigger boom and, therefore, more power.<h2>Can you turbo a supercharged car?</h2>Yes. You can Use both. The concept of supercharger and Turbocharger are slightly different.<h2>Can Nos damage your engine?</h2>Will nitrous injection damage my engine? The use of a correctly designed, high quality nitrous oxide system, that is fitted and used correctly within prescribed safe limits, will put your engine at little to no risk of damage.<h2>Can you spray nitrous with a turbo?</h2>Dave Vasser: Both a turbocharger and supercharger can greatly benefit from adding nitrous. The results vary with different applications. Keep in mind that keeping intake air temps down helps aid in detonation.<h2>How much HP is a 100 shot of NOS?</h2>Maxwell: A “shot” is typically how much horsepower the nitrous system is adding to the engine. For instance, a “hundred shot” is adding 100 flywheel horsepower on top of what the engine makes normally. The horsepower level of the nitrous kit can is easily changed by swapping out metering jets.<h2>How long does a 10lb nitrous bottle last?</h2>A: It depends on bottle capacity and the size of the nitrous shot being used. On the 75hp setting, a 10 lb. bottle will last around 10 quarter mile runs. On the 125hp setting the bottle will last around 6 runs.<h2>Why is NOS illegal in a car?</h2>It is not illegal to store or transport them in most states, but it is unlawful to use nitrous oxide as an inhalant, and in the case of automotive-grade nitrous, it can be hazardous because of the added sulfur. For track-only vehicles or vehicles driven only on private property, nitrous oxide is legal everywhere.<h2>What octane is nitrous?</h2>Use of a premium type leaded or unleaded fuel of 92, or greater, octane is recommended for most applications. Most Ny-Trex performance systems are designed for use with service station pump gas. However, when higher compression or higher horsepower levels are used, a racing fuel of 100 octane, or more, must be used.<h2>What is cheaper nitrous or turbo?</h2>There's also the initial costs involved. If you have a target of, say, 2,000 horsepower, it is definitely going to be less expensive to get there with a nitrous setup than it would be with turbos.<h2>How much faster does NOS make a car go?</h2>We are talking, of course, about installing nitrous oxide—better known as NOS. When NOS is introduced to a combustion chamber, you can instantly stack a staggering amount of horsepower onto your engine. This output increase can range anywhere from 30 to a few hundred additional ponies under the hood.<h2>Is turbo better than nitrous?</h2>If you have a large displacement drag car that operates on staged nitrous oxide induction, you might not want to add a turbo because it won't make much of a difference. Turbos are great if the vehicle is able to suitably control the power of the wheels, drive shaft, tyres and the engine.<h2>Do you need a tune to run nitrous?</h2>There's much more to this story on fuels when using nitrous, but a safe start is to start tuning with a higher-octane fuel and then tune accordingly. Fuel pressure is an equally important part of the nitrous tune. Most systems are tuned for 56 psi of fuel pressure.<h2>Which is safer wet or dry nitrous?</h2>Being bit more serious, you can really up the power with a wet kit on your Mustang. However, with a wet nitrous kit, there is more risk of backfire. This is due to the fact fuel vapors can work their way into the intake tract, and if enough is there, they could ignite.<h2>Can you put 2 superchargers on a car?</h2>It's very rare to find two superchargers working in tandem on an engine. Many have tried, few have succeeded.<h2>Can you twin turbo a supercharger?</h2>Can you use a turbocharger and a supercharger? Yes, using a turbocharger in tandem with a supercharger is very much possible. In fact, racing cars have been using twin-charging (turbocharger+supercharger) to increase the power both at the low RPM band and the high RPM band.<h2>Which is faster turbo or supercharger?</h2>Supercharging Pros: Produces significantly more horsepower than turbocharging. A quick solution to boosting power in larger displacement engines with more cylinders. No power lag as is seen with turbocharging; power delivery is instantaneous.<h2>How can I add 200 hp to my car?</h2><p>How You Can Increase Horsepower and Torque?</p><li>Clean House to Increase Horsepower. ...</li><li>Perform a Tune-Up on the Engine. ...</li><li>Install a Turbo Kit or Supercharger. ...</li><li>Install a Cold-Air Intake. ...</li><li>Install an Aftermarket Exhaust System. ...</li><li>Buy an Engine Tuner.</li><h2>Does a supercharger ruin your engine?</h2>Superchargers use air to increase power, meaning that overboosting the supercharger will blow hot air into the engine and could cause damage.<h2>Can you just bolt on a supercharger?</h2>A bolt-on supercharger can add anywhere from 30 to 50% more power to an otherwise stock engine. The hot setup is a small displacement blower (say 144 cu. in.) running at an overdrive of 1.75 to 2.25 that delivers 6 to 9 psi of boost pressure on a small block V8.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8KapWaxn6p6orDDZqWirKKkwrR506hkmmWjqr2mvsKhmKuflac%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./companionlink-express-updates-outlook-android-and-iphone-sync-app-for-act-v25.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="CompanionLink Express Updates Outlook, Android and iPhone Sync App for Act! v25">&larr;
