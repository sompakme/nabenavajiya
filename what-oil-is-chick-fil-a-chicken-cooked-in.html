We then bread the wings yourself.<h2>Does Chick-fil-A use peanut oil on fries?</h2>According to the Chick-fil-A website, they use “100% refined peanut oil.” They go on to state that “refined soybean and peanut oil are not considered major food allergens.” In fact, refined peanut oil provides a perfect medium for creating crunchy foods at high heat without off flavors.<h2>Here's How Chick-fil-A Makes A Perfectly Crispy Chicken Sandwich | Southern Living</h2><p></p><h2>Does Chick-fil-A use peanut oil or canola oil?</h2>It's peanut oil.

If you are allergic to peanuts, ask your doctor whether you should avoid highly refined peanut oil. Everyone with peanut allergy should avoid cold-pressed, expelled or extruded peanut oils—sometimes called gourmet peanut oils.<h2>Does Chick-fil-A use pickle juice for marinating?</h2>It's the pickle brine!

Wrap the chicken loosely between plastic wrap and pound gently with the flat side of a meat tenderizer until about 1/2 inch thick all around. Cut into two pieces, as even as possible.

The result is a crispy piece of chicken without all the oil used in deep frying.<h2>Is Chick-fil-A processed chicken?</h2>As the nation's largest chicken chain, we take chicken seriously. Chick-fil-A sources 100% real, whole, boneless breast of chicken that has never been ground or separated, and that contains no fillers or added steroids or hormones*.<h2>What oil does Wendy's use?</h2>Wendy's fries will be made with 100% corn oil; Burger King's version will use soybean and cottonseed oils. Both chains will offer the reformulated fries by fall.
