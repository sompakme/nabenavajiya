The footballer-turned-actor, 54, told the <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Sunday Mirror</a> he has cried "almost every night" since Tanya - whom he was married to for 25 years - passed away in their Hollywood home on 6 July. Speaking of her final moments, Vinnie revealed: "I was cuddling her and holding her hand and when she finally went it felt like Tinkerbell had released from her into the room. I got peace from that."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/feace3c383c4-vinnie-jones-tanya-jones-z.jpg><p id=eyZhcJGjEWS69 data-wc=12><strong>Tanya died of cancer on 6 July at the age of 53</strong></p><p id=eAWONrpdmtCHA data-wc=82>The former sportsman then read out a handwritten love letter his wife left behind, emblazoned with the words 'Always Believe Something Wonderful is About to Happen'. He shared: "To my love Vin, something wonderful happens to me every day. Itâ€™s being with you. You are my morning sunshine the moment I wake. All my love, Tanya." Upon reading the note, which he carries everywhere with him, Vinnie said: "I broke down when I read it because I loved her like that too."</p><p id=e12Og49sM7vDC data-wc=1><strong>READ: <a class=hm-link href=#>Vinnie Jones thanks fans for their sympathy after the tragic death of his wife Tanya</a></strong></p><p id=edL4BNYlkhELr data-wc=128>The couple shared one son together, Aaron, who joined the Army in 2008 and Tanya also had a daughter called Kaley from a previous marriage. Of his wife's final days, Vinnie recalled: "In that last week of her life when the doctors said there were no more treatments, I never told her she was dying. We never spoke of that, I didn't want her to know. In the hospital I slept there every night and Kaley would come every morning." Vinnie then revealed he was by her side when she died, surrounded by her loved ones. "We knew it was the end, we were cuddling her," he said. "I kissed her a lot and told her I loved her. I kept saying, 'I love you, I love you'."</p><p id=etnGcgAskHy04 data-wc=1><strong>WATCH: <a class=hm-link href=#>Fab four reunited!
