In two minutes and 15 seconds, the plane dropped from an altitude of 29,100ft to 9075ft, according to Flight tracking website FlightRadar24. The last reported altitude for the plane was 3225ft.</p><p>Witness video shows the plane in a near-vertical dive towards a mountainside seconds before it crashed.</p><p>During this time, an aviation expert claims the pilots would have been powerless to rescue the plane, as the huge drop in altitude would have rendered the passengers and crew unconscious.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>Flight commentator Sally Gethin said that while the gravitation force from the 6000m plunge would have knocked the pilots out, flight data may have shown the "10 to 20-second spell where one or more of the pilots regained consciousness and tried to save the plane," she told The Sun.</p><p>The plane was carrying 132 air crew and passengers and there are no reported survivors.</p><p>FlightRadar24 showed no more data for flight MU5735 after 2.22pm local time.</p><p>The director of aviation consultancy firm Cirium said the Boeing 737 jet was one of the safest planes ever made and struggled to explain how the incident happened.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>"The 737 NG has been in operation for 25 years and has an excellent safety record," he told Bloomberg.</p><p>"I'm not going to speculate on what happened but if the Flightradar24 logs are accurate, something seems to have happened abruptly and the plane nose dived from cruising altitude."</p><p>The Civil Aviation Administration of China said in a statement that the crash occurred near the city of Wuzhou in the Guangxi region. The flight was travelling from Kunming in the southwestern province of Yunnan to the industrial centre of Guangzhou along the east coast, it added.</p><p>Local villagers were first to arrive at the forested area where the plane went down and sparked a blaze big enough to be seen on Nasa satellite images.

All 44 people on board were killed. Investigators blamed pilot error.</p><p>Aviation experts said they expect that China will ask the US National Transportation Safety Board for help, although a safety board spokesman said Monday that had not happened yet.</p><p>The US Federal Aviation Administration, which certified the 737-800 in the 1990s, said it was ready to help in the investigation if asked.</p><p>Crash investigations are usually led by officials in the country where the crash occurred, but they typically include the aeroplane's manufacturer and the investigator or regulator in the manufacturer's home country.</p><p>Shahidi said he expects investigators to comb through the maintenance history of the plane and its engines, the training and records of the pilots, air traffic control discussions and other topics.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/HnL75Dy9zeCVInwk-XJ-fqAyu1E=/16x11/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/HB4VMPHZCJJFL6WMPOMARONHSU.jpg"><p>Chicago-based Boeing Co. said it was aware of reports of the crash and was trying to gather more information.
