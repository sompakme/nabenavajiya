Do not fret if you do not know what to say. Below are simple words to make her happy all day long.</p><ul><li>You are the most beautiful creature ever to have lived in this world, your eyes are like the night sky, your lips are as sweet as candy, and your voice is more melodic than any song ever written. You are simply perfection itself, and I love you.</li><li>Your voice is my lifesaver. I can’t go a day without hearing you call me sweet names. Your laughter makes me fulfilled. When you smile, I forget all my worries. I just want your life to be filled with happiness. I love you endlessly.</li><li>It’s scintillating how good I feel every morning just knowing how much you love me with all your heart. I have realised that you in my life make me the luckiest man alive. I want you to know whenever I smile, it’s because of you.</li><li>I promise to always be there, whenever you will need someone. I will be more than obliged to lend you a helping hand to help you work through the hard phase of life. I will be by your side together. We will scale through anything. Our love is divine.</li><li>I have travelled across dozens of countries and have seen the most beautiful places ever, but none of these can compare to the beauty of your eyes. The wonder of your smile and the melody of your voice mesmerises me. You are unparalleled to anything and everything else in this world. I love you beyond measure.</li><li>I have watched so many love movies, I have seen quite a couple of telle novellas, I have even read love novels and stories, there are nights I dream about falling in love, today I am living that dream, because, with you, I have found true love. Thank you for loving you.</li><li>I haven’t been so grateful in my life until I met you. You made me understand that I’m the one in the world. I think of the day we met. Thank you, my love! Without you, I’d not have been what I am today, and I’ll be thankful eternally for you giving me all the love one can provide.</li><li>I have seen quite a lot of women come and go, most of them very beautiful, charming, and enticing to be with. Whenever I got close to them, I find out they don’t have the qualities of a good woman, and then boom! You came along and proved that there is still a beautiful woman with brains. My children will forever be grateful to me because I have given them the best mother. With all of my heart, I will love you forever.</li><li>I am always at my best since you ventured into my life. I work harder, and I have this extraordinary belief that I can achieve anything once I set my mind to it. You have given me my lost confidence. I cannot love you any less. You are the best thing that happened to me.</li><li>At times, I imagine what would have become of me if fate had not brought us together. I guess my life would have been in a state of misery and wretchedness. My whole soul has been engulfed by your kindness and uniqueness. I love you so much.</li><li>Sometimes I just feel like calling you in the early hours of the morning, your voice gives me a boost, you are my best talk buddy, my sweetheart choc. How can I go on without you? You are so important to me. May you shine brighter than the morning sun.</li><li>If you ask me how much I love you, I probably can’t complete two sentences. I am pretty sure whenever I hug or kiss you, and you feel that what I have for you Is out of this world. I just want to make you happy every day of your life because that is the only way I can express my love to you.</li><li>Your kind is rare, so I must keep you safe and protect you so I don’t lose you. I hold you in reverence and high esteem. I’m more than willing to take this relationship to another level where we would be together forever. You are my treasure, and I promise to put a smile on your face all the days of your life. I love you!</li><li>In this life that is full of ups and downs, you inspire me to overcome. The love you give me daily is more than enough strength to be a better person. I promise to always be hard-working to see that we are set for life. You will make the best mom for our kids. I am so proud of you.</li><li>I hit the jackpot for life! I couldn’t have asked God for a better companion. You are ultimately the best partner for me, for you understand me so well. You deserve much more than a medal. You deserve everything good on this earth. I cherish you, my love. Thank you so much.</li><li>You are my biggest addiction. I can’t seem to get enough of you. My thoughts, mind, and heart are occupied by you. Losing you is my worst fear and that’s why I will never let go. You are and will remain the only girl in my life. I love you endlessly and am happy I have you beside me.</li><li>Now and then, I try to put in words how I love you so much. I want to tell you the exact length I can go to see that you remain happy the rest of your life. The more I try to put them in words, I fail miserably. I love you so much, words aren’t just enough.</li><li>I will never betray you or do anything to hurt you. I love you too much to risk losing you. You are the brightest spot in my day. Without you, my life would be all darkness. I am so in love with you that it is hard to think straight. All I want is to be in love with you for the rest of my life.</li><li>You don’t know how relieving and awesome it is for me to return from my hectic everyday job, knowing fully well I am coming home to meet the best woman in the world. Seriously, you are like the shore I return to after my rigorous activities. I am really the luckiest man alive to have you as mine. I adore you.</li><li>You are that unique star, shining in those dark corners of my life. You spread good vibes in my life. I am having the best time of my life with you. I don’t look outside anymore. I have all I need in you. I love you much.</li><li>I feel so proud of you. That’s why you get a lot of tags and mentions on all my social media handles, I love you so much, and I won’t get tired of letting the whole world know you are awesome, and it’s a great feeling showing off a lovely person. I am happy I have you in my life.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/08e787a5591f4e5f.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Is Carol Burnett still alive, and what is she up to now?</span></p></a><h3>Emotional love quotes for her</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/642151716e8a8d7d.png><p class=align-left>You can use these cute and passionate words to tell your girl how she makes you feel.
