He went on to earn a Ph.D from New York's Binghamton University before moving southwest after being offered a teaching position at New Mexico State University, where he met fellow faculty member Jennifer Montgomery—the woman who would later become his wife and mother to his son Pete.</p><p>The professor started working at Notre Dame in the '80s and was an English professor at the prestigious university until 2017, even serving as the department chair at one point. (A personal note: Though I never met him, he was a certified legend by the time I went to ND for undergrad. Everyone, including non-liberal arts majors, knew and loved him, and his courses were always in crazy-high demand.)

"With encouragement from his dad, Pete headed to Washington to announce an exploratory committee for a presidential campaign. Four days later, Joe Buttigieg was dead."</p><h2 id=pete-posted-a-sweet-sad-tribute-3>Pete posted a sweet, sad tribute.</h2><p>After Joseph passed away, Pete said, "[W]e are left with memories of his powerful intellect, his extensive legacy, his personal warmth and his deeply felt love for Mom, me, and all those close to him."</p><p>"The last thing he said to us was, 'it’s been a good trip.' So it has. We love you, Dad."</p><p>He also spoke about his father at a Notre Dame memorial. "A bit cruelly, it is in preparing for an occasion like this that I would be most likely to turn to Dad for advice...I look back, I followed his suggestions so often, and found that they always led me somewhere I needed to be—and wanted to be."</p><h2 id=he-apos-s-been-talking-about-his-father-on-the-campaign-trail-3>He's been talking about his father on the campaign trail.</h2><p>Pete spoke about his father's illness and the tough decisions he and his family had to make in the last weeks of Joseph's life. It connected to his thoughts about Medicare and health care access:</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>When my dad became ill, what we didn’t have to think about was whether it would lead to bankruptcy in our family -- because leaders made a choice to give us Medicare.

His mom, Montgomery, travels to his speeches and to events; In addition to supporting her son, she says, it's also a helpful distraction for the grief she feels about losing her husband. "If I didn’t have his career secondhand, I don’t know what I would do. I would be in anguish," she explains. Chances are as Pete heads farther into the primaries, we may hear more about his father and the importance of family to him.</p><p>For more stories like this, including celebrity news, beauty and fashion advice, savvy political commentary, and fascinating features, sign up for the&nbsp;Marie Claire&nbsp;newsletter.</p><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://link.marieclaire.com/join/3oa/mar-newsletter?authId=F0CC0C27-80DA-4734-ABDF-E4115B84A56B&maj=WNL&min=ARTICLES" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>SUBSCRIBE HERE</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaKifoba1tcKsZppqZm2DeISWbWajp6Oaval5wa6rraGXnrKoec%2Beq55lkqrBtbXGopygZZaWwamx0Wg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./33-characters-with-big-foreheads-from-anime-cartoons-and-films.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="33 characters with big foreheads from anime, cartoons and films">&larr;
