To see if you qualify for an installment payment plan, attach a Form 9465, “Installment Agreement Request,” to the front of your tax return.<h2>How many years does the IRS go back to collect on unfiled tax returns?</h2>The IRS can go back to any unfiled year and assess a tax deficiency, along with penalties.
