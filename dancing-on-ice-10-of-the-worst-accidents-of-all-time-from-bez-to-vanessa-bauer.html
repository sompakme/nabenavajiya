He and his partner, Alexandra Schauman performed their routine to George Ezra's Paradise when they attempted to pull off a very risky move, but it didn't quite go to plan.</p><p id=elHgaFnVdsj_ data-wc=55>Connor fell on the ice and was disappointed to hear the fall meant he had a dip in scores. On Instagram soon after, he revealed the extent of his injures. "I went into the show knowing I was [accident prone] and I knew it was dangerous, but I didn’t know how sharp the blades were."</p><p id=esi4w-SdVf-- data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Oti Mabuse dances with husband Marius in epic performance following Strictly exit</a></strong></p><p id=epWVuiBNL3Bv data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Holly Willoughby has a total princess moment in jaw-dropping Dancing on Ice dress</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6ef22e4bde45-conor-ball-doi-z.jpg><p id=e3PLzBwnIkaJ data-wc=10><strong>Connor fell on the ice during his routine to Paradise</strong></p><p id=eoOnNG1nRVOS data-wc=42>He later told Metro Online: "When I tore off my trousers I was like 'Ahh there's a big hole in my leg!'

Ouch!</p><h2 dir=ltr>Mark Berry 'Bez'&nbsp;</h2><p id=eoxfbHc6hNRY data-wc=82>Happy Monday's star Bez took a serious tumble on the ice during his second day in training for the 2022 series. Bez fell to the ground on his back and hit his head on the ice, causing his helmet to fly off. A video later emerged of the fall, which showed his skating partner, Angela Egan, rushing to his aid. In the clip, Angela can be heard saying, 'Give yourself a minute,' while he crouched on the ice while holding his head.&nbsp;</p><p id=euxiMMT7_QNy data-wc=30>Bez now wears a helmet when he takes to the ice and has said that it has been a "lifesaver after his many and often brutal falls in the rink".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/aa109eb82bd9-bez-helmet-z.jpg><p id=e0WQE8XJ6A25 data-wc=10><strong>Bez has to wear a helmet while on the ice</strong></p><h2>Joe Swash</h2><p id=e63VzjrfZTpA data-wc=54><a class=hm-link href=#>Joe Swash</a> managed to last until the final week in the 2020 series without serious&nbsp;injury. However, just a few days before the final, the former soap star was rushed to hospital for emergency surgery.

It wouldn't be a final if something hadn't gone wrong for us."&nbsp;</p><p id=eBQjcpgzup5l data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Brendan Cole speaks out on amazing first DOI performance after thinly-veiled dig at Strictly</a></strong></p><p id=eJjir9Y_bgp4 data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Who is Regan Gascoigne's famous relatives?

The 23-year-old shared a horrific video showing her nasty fall, later telling her fans: "Although I feel ok I am not allowed to skate this weekend… After banging my head into the wall I feel fine but @itv is super cautious and really takes care of us skaters which is why I went through SO many tests… For the sake of my health, I have to rest my brain."</p><p id=eO21R06xFm9p data-wc=45>Luckily Vanessa was given the all-clear to perform again the following week. Sharing her good news on her Instagram Stories, Vanessa said: "Finally been given the green light to skate again. Thanks so much for all of your get well messages that meant a lot."</p><h2>Michael Barrymore</h2><p id=eH_wTfD0B6kD data-wc=45><span><strong>Michael Barrymore</strong></span>'s big TV comeback wasn't to be as the former Strike It Lucky presenter was forced to pull out of the 2020 series weeks before it had even started.

He was replaced by Blue Peter presenter Radzi Chinyanganya.</p><h2>Gemma Collins</h2><p id=eiLdbmCD1zUV data-wc=85>Reality TV star <a class=hm-link href=#>Gemma Collins </a>suffered a dramatic fall during a live episode of Dancing On Ice in 2019. While she got up and continued her routine, Gemma later revealed that she had damaged her knee, which she says still hasn't fully healed. In December, the 38-year-old told the Express: "It’s only recently I’ve been able to touch my knees again. They were very painful. I mean my knee has just slightly gone down. I’ve got a lot of fluid on my knee from Dancing On Ice."</p><p id=ecVqVj9QS3ua data-wc=6><strong>Gemma fell during a live performance</strong></p><p id=esT7ex59hORq data-wc=39>But Gemma claims that wasn't the worst of her injuries.

Luckily, Brandee was uninjured but I was taken to hospital where I discovered I had fractured a couple of ribs, front and back."</p><p id=etTXj96RKubx data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Ben Foden's wife hits out at Dancing on Ice: 'Just a popularity competition'</a></strong></p><h2>Jennifer Ellison</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8e1e7c2f38f3-jennifer-ellison-z.jpg><p id=eBYOBW9VU0S6 data-wc=5><strong>Jennifer sliced her head open</strong></p><p id=eIRAhG7ZUHeR data-wc=111>Jennifer Ellison has her own flexibility to blame for her horrific accident back in 2012. The actress managed to slice the top of her head open with her skate blade – yet still finished her routine! It was only after her performance that she was rushed backstage to receive medical attention as blood started pouring from her scalp. Explaining the incident to host Phillip Schofield, her pro partner Daniel said at the time: "Jen is so flexible she did the Scorpion kick and hit the heel of her skate into the back of her head." Luckily for Jennifer, she was patched up and was back on the ice the following week.</p><h2>Matt Evers</h2><p id=ehBEDmd1rIB6 data-wc=48>There is plenty of trust needed between the professional skater and their partner, especially when it comes to some of the more daredevil moves. But sometimes, accidents do happen, as former Hollyoaks actress Jorgie Porter learnt when she accidentally sliced open her partner Matt Evers' face in 2012.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/463fa2049d59-matt-evers-injury-z.jpg><p id=eLxzPmMG8xuz data-wc=5><strong>Matt suffered a sliced face</strong></p><p id=e6n8sFM0Rf9Q data-wc=64>During their rehearsal, the actress was preparing for a dangerous stunt when she brought her legs up around Matt's neck. However, Jorgie slipped and sent her skate blade straight across her partner's face. He was taken to hospital and received stitches but was soon back on the ice to perform their routine on the live show – which luckily went off without a hitch.</p><h2>Vanilla Ice</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/fe04cad94fac-vanilla-ice-doi-z.jpg><p id=e3dI8p-_-X04 data-wc=5><strong>Vanilla Ice cracked his eye</strong></p><p id=eSTKIeGpUm5Z data-wc=55>In 2011, Vanilla Ice suffered a gruesome injury after a very nasty fall on the ice during rehearsals.
