The genre gave Discovery the money to complete its $43 billion April merger with Warner Bros. In October, it propelled onetime alternative exec Rob Wade to the top post at Fox Entertainment. And as many cable networks wave the white flag, it’s allowed Bravo to thrive and even segue into the events space — recently luring 30,000 attendees to BravoCon in New York. Sure, it may never be as sexy as scripted — figuratively, that is … there’s still quite a bit of sex in reality TV — but unscripted bankrolls Hollywood. So, when revisiting its rundown of the most powerful players in the arena for the first time in seven years, THR looked to the ones truly wielding that power: the producers who know how to deliver both quality and quantity in a market where there aren’t enough suppliers to keep up with the demand. Yes, there’s some talent and other wild cards in the mix. But this is reality TV. Predictable would be boring.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4><h2>Fenton Bailey, Randy Barbato and RuPaul Charles</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/split_3_16x9_template_v1-copy-3.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Emboldened by the global success of RuPaul’s Drag Race, World of Wonder co-founders Bailey and Barbato have taken an interesting approach to capitalizing on the franchise’s success. International versions of the VH1 flagship, which runs two cycles in the U.S. each year alongside spinoff Untucked, air domestically on the proprietary WOW Presents Plus app for fans willing to pony up $4.99 a month. Charles, an executive producer on all Drag Race titles, remains an industry force. He took home his seventh Emmy for hosting in September.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>Last big sacrifice to stay on budget</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>BAILEY AND BARBATO</strong> “Pay for the fucking thing ourselves.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>Nicole Byer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1243685884-H-2022.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The comedian and actress obviously has a lot more going on than just reality, but Byer, nominated three times for hosting Netflix favorite Nailed It!, is a guaranteed green light to any project she toplines. Also an executive producer on Nailed It!, Byer tops Hollywood’s hosting ask lists and occasionally has room on her dance card to take the call —recently toplining the TBS revival of Wipeout alongside John Cena.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>Format I’d most like to reboot </strong>“The Swan or More to Love.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>Chris Coelen</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Chris-Coelen_headshot_template-H-2022.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">With three of the most watched unscripted shows on Netflix — originals Love Is Blind and The Ultimatum, as well as the second window for Lifetime flagship Married at First Sight — Coelen’s Kinetic Content shingle (acquired by The North Road Company in July) has become one of the most successful outfits in the game. His upcoming slate includes projects at virtually every streamer, while his latest co-production (Claim to Fame) proved to be a summer sleeper for ABC.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>Why won’t anyone buy my pitch about …</strong> “The love lives of Shetland ponies.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>Andy Cohen</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1243969034-H-2022.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Not just the face of Bravo with nightly talk show Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen, the multihyphenate remains a driving force behind the cable channel’s robust slate of original unscripted series — namely the sprawling Real Housewives franchise. Cohen, who toplined three fevered days at BravoCon in October, has been particularly focused on expanding and rebranding the New York iteration with a new cast and a spinoff for select alums. He’s also toeing the company line, helping feed originals to NBCUniversal streamer Peacock (see: Ultimate Girls Trip).</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>Too much time at my job is spent…</strong> “Dealing with Twitter outrage.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=8.5><h2>David Collins, Rob Eric and Michael Williams</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/David-Collins-Rob-Eric-Michael-Williams-Publicity-Split-H-2022.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Driven by flagships Queer Eye (Netflix) and Legendary (HBO Max), Scout Productions is a go-to for inclusive content. With the trio of lead creatives, the company is also frequently experimenting with new platforms. Most recently, they reimagined fantasy format The Quest for kids at Disney+ and recently wrapped the second season of streetwear competition The Hype at HBO Max.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>If this weren’t my job, I’d be …</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>COLLINS</strong> “A large-farm-animal veterinarian in Ohio or fishing on the pro bass circuit.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>ERIC</strong> “A struggling musician who is also a fashion designer, baker, pottery teacher and an amateur milliner.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>Format I’d most like to reboot</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>WILLIAMS</strong> “I loved The Joe Schmo Show.

Absurdist cooking competition/game show Is It Cake? ranks as Netflix’s biggest unscripted debut of 2022 (season two is already in post), pizza clash Best in Dough is bolstering Hulu’s food offerings, a Project Greenlight revival with Issa Rae’s Hoorae is on deck at HBO Max, and Project Runway, back on Bravo, hits its landmark 20th season in the coming year. Additional projects are in the works at HBO, Hulu, Fox, Peacock and Univision.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>Format I’d most like to reboot</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>CUTFORTH AND LIPSITZ</strong> “The show that began our partnership was Bands on the Run on VH1.

In addition to producing 50 series annually (roughly 1,500 hours of programming across platforms), he’s launched massive specials (HBO Max’s Harry Potter 20th Anniversary: Return to Hogwarts), is nurturing invaluable franchises (ABC’s Bachelor-verse and NBC’s The Voice) and even dabbling in the occasional talk show (see Jennifer Hudson, his pal from having run American Idol at Fox).</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>If this weren’t my job, I’d be …</strong> “Playing piano in the Warner Bros. executive dining room.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>Adam DiVello</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/STOC_S1_GLAM_ADAMDIVELO_Singles01_0053R2C2-H-2022.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The longtime MTV executive who went on to create and showrun The Hills has found major fruits in his return to showcasing Southern California one-percenters. He launched Netflix hit Selling Sunset in 2019 under his Done and Done Productions banner and, with that franchise still going strong, followed up with Selling the OC in August. Both marry two unscripted standbys: real estate porn and petty drama.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>Why won’t anyone buy my pitch about … </strong>“A reality rom-com I’ve been pitching for years!

Under his Knuckle Sandwich production shingle, Fieri boasts four fruitful vehicles for himself (Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives; Guy’s Grocery Games; Guy’s Ranch Kitchen; Tournament of Champions), recently launched a new series from network neighbor Rae Drummond (Big Bad Budget Battle) and even premiered a splashy new celebrity format: Guy’s Ultimate Game Night.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>Why won’t anyone buy my pitch about …</strong> “Dashing chef becomes newest 007 … what could possibly go wrong?”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.5><h2>Bobby Flay</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1433509310-H-2022.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Leveraging his loyal Food Network audience, Flay secured a pricey three-year contract extension that began at the top of 2022. Under the pact, he still churns out dozens of episodes of Beat Bobby Flay, while his Rock Shrimp Productions shingle also delivers summer hit BBQ Brawl, recently kicked off competition Bobby’s Triple Threat and father-daughter docuseries Bobby and Sophie on the Coast. He’s got a lot more in development, too.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>Too much time at my job is spent … </strong>“Thinking about when the supply chain issues will come to an end.

And while those may all be at Netflix, he’s selling everywhere. Boardwalk was behind recent FX unscripted foray Welcome to Wrexham. The starry serial followed Rob McElhenney and Ryan Reynolds in their quest to overhaul a struggling Welsh football club.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>Format I’d most like to reboot</strong> “Iconoclasts. Coming up on that show at the beginning of my career remains a highlight for me, as was the experience of telling stories with such luminaries.

Their series now air on their own linear channel, Discovery+ and HBO Max. And while they are network bosses, they’re also producers. The Gaineses’ Blind Nil production company has already supplied 16 original programs to the growing network. Among them are flagships Fixer Upper: Welcome Home and Magnolia Kitchen.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=5.5><h2>David George</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/David-George-H-2022.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The CEO of ITV America remains one of the most consistent and prolific suppliers of unscripted content across cable, broadcast and streamers. George’s massive portfolio of acquired shingles produces such long-running successes as Queer Eye, Hell’s Kitchen, Love Island and Pawn Stars (550-plus episodes and counting). Also worth noting: ITV America’s Leftfield Productions is also responsible for Alone, the survivalist drama that is somehow a flagship for both History and Netflix, where it gets a second window.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>Too much time at my job is spent … </strong>“Talking about cost. We are all so consumed with the numbers that it can take us away from what got us here in the first place, and that’s being creative.

In non-Housewives programming, their growing slate also includes recent CW swing Would I Lie to You?

Their expanded portfolio now includes existing Sony properties such as Shark Tank and eight companies that SPT has either purchased or partnered with, most notably 90 Day Fiancé producers Sharp Entertainment.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>Why won’t anyone buy my pitch about …</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>HOLZMAN</strong> “A vegetable-growing competition.

Boasting a slightly more elevated aesthetic than its long-running E! predecessor, Jenner now produces the follow-up under a newly formed Kardashian Jenner Productions banner. Her slate, as of now, is just the one show.

Series Love & Marriage: Huntsville and spinoff Love & Marriage: DC are the top two Saturday players among African American women. More spinoffs are an inevitability.

Both perennial Emmy nominees and massive players for their respective platforms, Bravo and Netflix, the pair have also been exported to multiple territories — while continuing to evolve. The most recent season of Nailed It! was a cross-promotional orgy of Netflix talent, while the upcoming season of Top Chef moves the action abroad to London with 16 contestants from among the 29 territories where the show has aired.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>Format I’d most like to reboot</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>SHARON</strong> “Gallery Girls from Bravo.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>Person in TV I most admire right now</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>KRILEY</strong> “Zendaya.
