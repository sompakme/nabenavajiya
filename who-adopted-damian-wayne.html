As Ravager, Rose has followed in her father's footsteps in several ways, also becoming a highly trained assassin. Since Deathstroke is easily one of the best assassins in the DC Universe, Rose would, of course, be almost as deadly.<h2>Is Robin a Slade?</h2>According to this theory, Slade was actually a future version of Robin that the current Robin will eventually become. His transformation would happen sometime before Robin becomes Nightwing. After becoming Slade, he would then go back in time to the team's early days and attack them.<h2>Who is Slade Wilson's son?</h2>Entertainment Weekly is reporting that Camp and Lucifer star Liam Hall has signed on to play Joe Wilson, the son of Manu Bennet's Slade Wilson, for a two-part episode in the sixth season of The CW's DC show Arrow.<h2>Did Talia sleep with Jason?</h2>At this point, she renounced her love for Bruce and urged Jason to cross the line and be a vigilante without limits.
