Their custom is gradually gaining popularity. Elf on the Shelf generates $10 million in yearly sales and has achieved a position (No.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Also, are you familiar with how the elf on the shelf operates?</h3><p>‘Elf on the Shelf’ is a Christmas custom in which the North Pole sends a special scout to your house in order to urge children to be good and behave themselves. This is the concept: Santa’s small helper watches after the children throughout the day, and then returns to the North Pole at night to report on whether the youngsters were bad or lovely that day.</p><h3>Also, I’d want to know whether I can get only the elf on the shelf doll</h3><p>No, this is not the Original Scout Elf.

In 2004, Aebersold and Bell collaborated on a poem that would eventually become the narrative for the product.</p><h3>When should you put an end to Elf on the Shelf?</h3><p>According to the Elf on the Shelf firm, their product is intended for children between the ages of three and fifteen. In reality, most 15-year-olds will have long since given up in Santa and will likely consider Elf on the Shelf to be pathetic and intended only for little children.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>What happens when you come into contact with the elf?</h3><p>So, what should you do if your Scout Elf is unintentionally contacted by another person?
